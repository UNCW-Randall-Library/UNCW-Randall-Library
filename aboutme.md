## Welcome to the University of North Carolina Data Analysis Lab!   

We are located inside Randall library in room 1023H. We offer support in statistics and data analysis using R, SPSS, and Excel. Bring in a data set for your dissertation/thesis/honor's thesis, a course assignment, or your own personal project and we will walk you step by step on choosing the appropriate statistical analysis and help with interpretation of results. Don't have a data set? No problem! We can teach you how to get started and use different statistical programs that produce statistical analyses, data visualizations, and data cleaning software. Check out the R guides page under the resources tab to get started learning R! We offer in-person drop in hours and virtual drop in hours via Zoom. Come see us!
